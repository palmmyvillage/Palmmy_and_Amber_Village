Ahhh, brave [CharacterName]
You come. Of course you would come.
It is your duty, your destiny, your purpose.
But alas, you are too late.
The ritual has already been done. Her blood shall bring us the salvation.
We will all be forgiven. Us. The Villagers. That foolish king.
And you too, shall be free.
Now come, brave [CharacterName], watch it with your own eyes.
OUR REVELATION.
