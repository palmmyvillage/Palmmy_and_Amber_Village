We could't sleep well.
We keep having a nightmare of the town being destroyed by evil fiends.
The houses were burning. The sky kept bright and red whole night.
People ran and screamed.
Some people jumped into the water.
Some people were trampled to death.
No one survived from that disaster.
We pray they would be just a dream.
